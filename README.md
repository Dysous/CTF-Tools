# CTF-Tools

A growing collection of scripts and utilities for Capture the Flag (CTF) competitions.  
The goal of this repository is to provide easy-to-use tools that can save me time during competitions and serve as my personal toolkit for future challenges.

## Current Projects

### Wiki Table Scraper to Wordlist
A Python script that scrapes the list of Game Boy games from Wikipedia and builds a wordlist.  
This can be useful for:
- **Wordlist generation** (for cracking challenges or custom dictionaries)
- **General scripting practice** with `BeautifulSoup`

Features:
- Grabs all table columns across multiple tables
- Saves results to a UTF-8 encoded `wordlist.txt`

## Future Tools
This repository is intended to grow over time with more utilities.  
Some projects I would like to add if I get the time:

- **Custom Wordlist Generator**  
  Scripts to build dictionaries from other common online sources (goodreads, spotify, etc.)

- **Web Exploitation Scripts**  
  Automating SQLi payload testing, fuzzing parameters, or session tampering.

- **Automatic Log Analyzer**  
  Helper for automating log analysis and noticing suspicious behavior.
