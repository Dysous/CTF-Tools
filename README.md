## Future Tools
This repository is intended to grow over time with more utilities.  
Some projects I would like to add if I get the time:

- **Custom Wordlist Generator**  
  Scripts to build dictionaries from other common online sources (goodreads, spotify, etc.)

- **Web Exploitation Scripts**  
  Automating SQLi payload testing, fuzzing parameters, or session tampering.

- **Automatic Log Analyzer**  
  Helper for automating log analysis and noticing suspicious behavior.
